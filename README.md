This is a simple CSS file that you can use with HTML. All class names are written in comments so just use class attribute to make your HTML object animation.

Now a days CSS animations are the perfect way to make your website more attractive. Here I am posting a CSS Animation Library. This is a GITHUB open source project and you can also contribute in this Library. It is a great pleasure for us. 

Jazzina Animation Library or JAL will make your life easy in animations of CSS.
